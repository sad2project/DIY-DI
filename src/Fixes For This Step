Step 2 Principle: Value Objects
+ Separate service objects from value objects
+ Value objects...
  + hold state
  + are easy to create in tests
+ Service objects...
  + perform work
  + are harder to fake in tests
  
Code changes: Move Trade Services
+ Many objects in the system are going to pass around Trade objects
+ Trades depend on market prices and accounts
+ Tests would be easier to write if those dependencies didn't need to be mocked
+ The "buy" method should be moved out
+ The resulting class in a simple value object
