Step 5 Principle: Thin Harness
+ The entry point into your application is sometimes required to extend a third-
party object, such as "HttpServlet", "ApplicationWrapper", or "Activity"
+ Business logic should be moved elsewhere easier to test
+ The entry point itself will only need to be covered by scenario tests, not unit
tests
  
Code changes: Simplify TradingApplication
+ The TradingApplication class extends an ApplicationWrapper
+ An ApplicationWrapper is probably difficult to construct in tests
+ All business logic should be moved elsewhere
+ The command-line argument parsing can be moved to a helper class that gets its
own tests
