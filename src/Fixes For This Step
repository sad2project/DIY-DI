Step 6 Principle: Injector
+ Business logic and glue code are best separated
+ Moving glue code to its own injector file conveys intention and keeps it
organized
+ Creating many small injection helpers - one to create each object - makes the
production bindings easy to read
  
Code changes: Create TradingInjector
+ A new TradingInjector class should be created
+ All production bindings that we had implemented in constructors should be
moved to the injector class
+ Complicated bindings become simpler because they can be broken out into 
multiple small injection helpers

Injection Guidelines:
+ Injection helpers contain too many sprawling dependencies to be unit tested
+ Injection helpers need to be trivial
+ Injection helpers can call other injection helpers but product code never should

Inject Control Flow:
+ First, the top-most injection helper is called
+ It delegates to other injection helpers, which in turn delegate to others
+ The return value is a complete object graph
+ After that, the injectors are out of the picture while the application executes
