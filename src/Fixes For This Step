Step 7 Principle: Providers
+ Sometimes it's necessary to keep a dependency on a factory
  + Multiple instances are needed
  + Lazy construction is desired
+ The dependency should be made as simple as possible
+ The "Provider" pattern can be tested without needing mock objects
  
Code changes: Provider Interface
+ The Provider interface can be created once and used throughout the application
+ P.S. this is exactly the same as Java's Supplier interface (but this was 
written before Java 8, so we'll forgive that. Plus, we'll be adding the utility
into the interface through static methods, which are now allowed on them.)

Providers Utility
+ The Providers utility (which, due to static methods now being allowed in 
interfaces, will actually be in the Provider interface) can be created once and
used in all the tests
+ Tests just need to invoke "Provider.of(value)" to create a Provider test
