Step 7 Principle: Demeter
+ The Law of Demeter says objects should avoid asking for dependencies that they
don't need
+ For example, instead of asking for a factory, ask for the object produced by
the factory
+ In practice, this is hard to follow unless the project uses injection helpers
  
Code changes: Simplify BookingService
+ The BookingService should remove its dependency on the MarketClient and ask
directly for the settlement amount instead.
+ A new SettlementCalculator helper can calculate the settlement amount
+ The SettlementCalculator also only needs a price, not the whole MarketClient
+ The glue code is the only place that needs to reference the MarketClient
